            <p class="lead"> My first step was to make a plan for the week. How would I divide my time?
            Along the way, various questions came up from participants, data, and feedback sessions which led to going back and forth
            across this plan. With a week's timeline I prioritized user feedback and incorporated it at multiple points in the workflow.
            </p>
            <p class="lead"> Seeing mutiple surveys on this same prompt on student listservs at U of M, I chose to not do another survey due to the possibility of gathering biased data.
            Instead I focussed on stakeholder interviews, user interviews, iterating on wireframes, and gathering feedback on prototypes.</p>

                   shoes (by googling ways to find student organizations on campus), 5 thirty minute semi structured interviews with students (grad and undergrad) , 1 stakeholder interview, and 1 expert interview with a former student organization leader at the University of Michigan.

        <h4>insights and learnings from research</h4>

        <p class="lead">On analysing the qualitative data and the numbers from secondary research, I started hearing a few common concerns which helped refine the research questions and generate patterns to answer through my design.</p>
  <h4><strong style="color:#0F9D58;">Artifacts created - Refined research questions and design principles</strong></h4>
        <p class="lead"> Browse - What motivates and achieves student involvement in organizations and events?</p>
        <blockquote>
          The motivation behind looking for student organizations was rooted in tribalism, skill development , cultural familiarity, and networking through attending <strong>events</strong> hosted around campus.
          Students discovered organizations through events and found out about the events through social media, word of mouth, and occasionally school emails.
        </blockquote>

        <p class="lead" style="color:#4285F4;"><strong>DESIGN PRINCIPLE</strong>: Proposed solution should provide an inclusive space for students to search and be part of a diverse
        set of organizations as well as events. It should allow for flexibility and customization through conventional mediums without causing an information overload.</p>

        <p class="lead"> Search - How do students currently search for student organizations at U of M?</p>
        <blockquote>
          Students searched for organizations through social media like Facebook groups, newsletters on school related listservs, LinkedIn profiles of seniors , and word of mouth depending on their academic or cultural
          interests.
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
          The orientation team introduces various student organizations on campus during the first week of orientation which happens in the first semester.
          Suprisingly, NONE of the participants recalled this as a source of information for campus involvement.
        </blockquote>

        <p class="lead" style="color:#4285F4;" ><strong >DESIGN PRINCIPLE</strong>: Students and orientation teams' prespectives on student organizations and its time of introduction
        might not overlap. Students requires a more need based and progressive access to this information as they get comfortable with campus culture. The solution
      should introduce student organizations at multiple points during a college life workflow.</p>

        <p class="lead"> Propose - What do students not like about student organizations and campus involvement activities?</p>
        <blockquote>
          The common causes for frustration with student organizations was the lack of a "source of truth" which had updated information.
          <a href="https://campusinvolvement.umich.edu/maize-pages" target="_blank">U of M has 1600 student organizations live at the moment</a>. Students did not know that what they might be looking for already exists!
        </blockquote>
        <p class="lead" style="color:#4285F4;" ><strong >DESIGN PRINCIPLE</strong>: Proposed solution should prioritize reviews and the social aspect of community driven communication to aid in search for information.</p>

               <p class="lead" style="font-size: 28px !important;"> 2. Students can filter by categories of interests, stay updated with articles on their feed, and find events around them.
                 Organization specific pages provide details like feedback from past members, pictures from events, and easy way to follow plus join them.

                 3. The orientation team can have a centralized place to track organizations and events on campus (through CSI employee login). They can also easily

            <h4>What could I do differently next time</h4>
            <p class="lead">Through this design exercise I tried to follow <a href="https://medium.com/productmanagement101/design-sprints-at-google-85ff62fed5f8" target="_blank">Google's design sprint phases</a>.
            That helped ensure I had a deliverable at the end of the week and also <strong>appreciate</strong> the need for a team! As I was creating the prototype a bunch of questions came up and some of them required more research. If I could go back in time I would introduce more methods to collect
          user input and create a paper prototype.  </p>
          <p class="lead"> A critical aspect of the proposed solution requires questioning scalability for a campus as big as U of M. A few other questions that can determine the value
            this solution brings to the proposed prompt are:
            Will the number of categories increase overtime? What is the impact of feedback received from students? Will having a version of the solution for
            the orientation team discourage students to give honest feedback?
          </p>
